A One upon a time in a land far away.
A Under a purple sun, on a planet of blue clay.

A family of Scaries walking this way,
A The run, the laugh, they hug, they play.

A A big one and a small one, they stroll hand in hand.
A They search for gum berries all over the land.

A The small one is Itty Bitty,
B with fur blue and green.
A The big one is Big Scary,
B his fur is not green,
B he has striped fur like a bumblebee.

The stroll through the orange woods,
Looking for mama,


Run! No, No, No it is too scary.
Its arms are so long and its head is so hairy.

Say Hi! How are you! We are two monsters,
Big and small. A papa and baby, 

What is your name, you who are so very tall?
